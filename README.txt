Purpose: Private GitHub repository for Fall 2014 COMP 20 Web Programming class.

Favorite lab/assignment: Marauder's map because I got to explore both the Google Maps API and the Heroku database.

Growth from day 1 of this course to now: SO MUCH! In addition to learning just Javascript/HTML/CSS/JQuery, I learned how code is translated into visual form.  

Most important things I learned in this course:
1. Don't re-invent the wheel.
2. Never trust data from the user.

Further interests after taking this class: Human Computer Interaction and UX/UI.
