Implemented correctly: Everything?
Incorrectly: Nothing?
Notes: Giving a name that is not in the MongoDB currently returns {"characters":[], "students":[]}
		Also, when accessing the website on Heroku, some of the inputs have "created_at" as "undefined"
		because I forgot to add the "created_at" field in the initial POSTs
